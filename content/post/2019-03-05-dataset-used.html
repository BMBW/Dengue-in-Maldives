<p>In the study, dataset used mainly contains 4 variables. For the convenience of analyzing, these variables were organized into monthly values. Variable data were organized into the 7 provinces in Maldives, namely,</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Upper North Province</li>
<li>North Pronvince</li>
<li>North Central Province</li>
<li>Central Province</li>
<li>South Central Province</li>
<li>Upper South Province</li>
<li>South Province</li>
</ol>
<p>the 4 variables considered are</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Dengue Cases - Dengue cases were available from 1998-2016. Dengue cases collected were atoll wise and they had to be categorized into the 7 provinces.</p></li>
<li><p>Minimum Tempearture (°C) - Minimum temperatures were available from 2005-2016. Data of some of the provinces were daily data. They had to be aggregrated into monthly data.</p></li>
<li><p>Maximum Temperature (°C) - Maximum temperatures were available from 2005-2016. Data of some of the provinces were daily data. They had to be aggregrated into monthly data.</p></li>
<li><p>Rainfall (mm) - Rainfall from 2005-2016. Data of some of the provinces were daily data. They had to be aggregrated into monthly data. Total rainfall and sometimes average rainfall was considered according to necessity.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Dengue cases were collected from the Health Department of Maldives and temperature &amp; rainfall data were collected from the Meterological Department of Maldives. Except North and Central provinces, other provinces have weather stations. So, except North and Central provinces, other provinces’ climate data (minimum &amp; maximum temperature, rainfall) were available. Climate data of these 2 provinces had to be estimated. To estimate those values, Inverse DistanceWeighted Inter- polation Method was used by considering longitudes and latitudes of the provinces.</p>
<p>Population of the provinces were also needed to calculate the dengue incidence. They were taken from the department of Census &amp; Statistics of Maldives.</p>
