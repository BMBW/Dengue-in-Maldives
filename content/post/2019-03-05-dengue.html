<p>Dengue, a mosquito borne viral disease, is a disease that is endemic in most tropical and subtropical regions in the world. Dengue is considered as one of the worldâ€™s major emerging infectious diseases with a significant morbidity and mortality. The number of dengue cases vary from year to year and season to season and it has the possibility to reach epidemic proportions.</p>
<p>According to Moosa, although 95% of global dengue burden is attributed to environmental factors such as temperature, precipitation and humidity, other factors such as change in pattern of rainfall, poor waste management and increase in migration can also result in an increase in dengue incidence. Mosquitoes are extremely sensitive to external temperature and moisture levels with temperature affecting the size of the vector and infectivity. Changes in temperature, precipitation can affect dengue incidence. But mosquitoes can adapt to adverse temperature and moisture by thriving in microenvironments such as containers and drains.</p>
<p>Dengue is a seasonal viral disease associated with more humid and warmer weather. Increase in rainfall can affect vector density and transmission potential. As these mosquitoes require stagnant water to breed, both wet and dry conditions favour the growth of the vector. Hence rainfall timing and the co-variation of other climate factors are important to study dengue incidence. Increase in temperature can reduce the time taken for vector to breed and the incubation period of the pathogen. Therefore global average temperature increase can cause a rise in dengue epidemics.</p>
<p>Studies to understand mosquito development and survivorship are captured in the gonotropic cycle shown in figure 1. Environment factor includes temperature, water availability, and relative humidity. These influences vary in the four major stations of mosquito development. Temperature influences vector development rates, mortality, and behavior and controls viral replication within the mosquito. Variability in precipitation influences habitat availability for Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus larvae and pupae.</p>
