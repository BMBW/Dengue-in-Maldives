Maldives is a tropical country composed of 26 geographic atolls, 7 provinces and
nearly 1200 small coral islands. A population of about 330000 is dispersed over
200 of these small islands, which extends to a length of 820 km and has a width
of 120 km. All the islands are low lying with an elevation of about 3 m above
the sea level. Maldives has an average year around rainfall between 1600-1900mm
contributed by the south-west (May-August) and north-east (October- January) monsoons. Maldives has a hot and humid climate with a temperature between
25°C-31°C and humidity between 70%-90%, throughout the year.

The seasonality of Maldives climate is fascinating as it traverses a section across
the equator and illuminates many mechanisms of climate such as the Trade Winds,
the Monsoon System, El Nino phenomenon, Indian Ocean Dipole, the Madden Julian
Oscillation, Storm and Cyclone Formation.
