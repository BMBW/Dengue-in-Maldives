      <description>Dengue, a mosquito borne viral disease, is a disease that is endemic in most tropical and subtropical regions in the world. Dengue is considered as one of the worldâ€™s major emerging infectious diseases with a significant morbidity and mortality. The number of dengue cases vary from year to year and season to season and it has the possibility to reach epidemic proportions.
Although 95% of global dengue burden is attributed to environmental factors such as temperature, precipitation and humidity, other factors such as change in pattern of rainfall, poor waste management and increase in migration can also result in an increase in dengue incidence.</description>

      <description>This is a post written in plain Markdown (*.md) instead of R Markdown (*.Rmd). The major differences are:
 You cannot run any R code in a plain Markdown document, whereas in an R Markdown document, you can embed R code chunks (```{r}); A plain Markdown post is rendered through Blackfriday, and an R Markdown document is compiled by rmarkdown and Pandoc.  There are many differences in syntax between Blackfriday&amp;rsquo;s Markdown and Pandoc&amp;rsquo;s Markdown.</description>
